0,Wonderful,"Takes around 15 minutes to cool the room when the outside temperature is ~35 degree celcius. Not that silent operation. But you will get used to it. Consumed around 8 units of electricity for 12 hour continuous operation with 5 star rated unit. Installation was quick and was done in a day after the product was delivered.The executives who came for installation were not authorised samsung service executives. However they did the job well. Overall a good buy, 100% value for money. A trusted brand.READ MORE",0.26904761904761904

Best thing is 10 yrs brand warranty on compressor and 5 years on condensor and pcb along with free gas recharge (no other company other than samsung provides this).

Nobody will wait for 15 days of return period for one wire.I THINK THE SEL...READ MORE",0.1813852813852814
